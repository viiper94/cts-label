<p>Dear {{ $name }}, dear friends, colleagues and partners!</p>

<p>Here is Sergiy Lazarev aka Sergio Mega - CTS Records Head of Label/A&R. <br>
    Our CEO Lilia Lazaryeva and me are open for meetings at ADE.</p>

<p>This year we are focused on: <br>
    - licensing out our catalogue (over 1400 house, deep house, tech-house, techno, progressive, chill-out tracks); <br>
    - presenting our ADE 2023 sampler and our artists & remixers roster; <br>
    - this year as always, we are looking for new outstanding underground house and techno productions for our label; <br>
    - we will also be able to share with you the latest and true news about the situation in our home country Ukraine</p>

<p>We will stay in Amsterdam from <b>Thursday 19th</b> till <b>Friday 20th</b> of October, please let us know 3 time slots suitable for you. <br>
    Normally we prefer to arrange our meetings at the Felix Meritis entrance or close around.</p>

<p>Looking forward to hearing from you.</p>

<p>You can also catch Lilia and me at <a href="https://www.amsterdam-dance-event.nl/en/program/2023/xcm-records-25-years/2164965">our event</a>
    which will be held in <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/NDSM+Theater+%2F+NDSM+Cafe/@52.4007778,4.8975371,17.13z/data=!4m6!3m5!1s0x47c60839b1afa55b:0xe04b32eddd29c405!8m2!3d52.4005949!4d4.8969948!16s%2Fg%2F11fzb0cb1f?authuser=0&entry=ttu"><b>NDSM Theater</b></a> on <b>Thursday 19th</b> with <b>Hanna Hais, Tito Torres, Bas Kunnen pres. NRG</b> and more. <br>
    We start at <b>20.00</b> so this could be a good point to start your night, and we would love to have you with us! <br>
    Enter is free, but it is always better to <a href="{{ route('guestlist') }}"><b>add your names to the guest list</b></a> because you know that full is full.
</p>

<p>- also this year CTS Records presents DJs Support Ukraine Project. <br>
    It will include series of short interviews of artists from the worldwide electronic music scene with words of support to their Ukrainian colleagues and all Ukrainian people. <br>
    So if you would like to send us some love please give your answers to following questions: <br>
    <b>Why do you support Ukraine?</b> <br>
    and <br>
    <b>What you'd like to wish to Ukrainian DJs and electronic musicians in such a hard time of war in Ukraine?</b> <br>
    And sure you can do it even if you are not a DJ. We will post the answers with your picture on our social media pages after ADE.
</p>
