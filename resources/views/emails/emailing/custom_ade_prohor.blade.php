    <p>This year we are focused on: <br>

        - Prohor’s bookings. We are looking for booking agent/agency for arranging and handling gigs requests for Europe and Asia.
        Prohor is based in Prague and available for these territories. <br>
        At the moment we have still open several slots on Thursday 19th in the morning and afternoon till 16.00 is also available. <br>
        Please let me know if you would like to meet Prohor in Amsterdam and suggest time slots suitable for you. <br>
        He prefers to arrange his meetings at the Felix or close around. <br>
        You can also catch Prohor after 20.00 in NDSM Theater after his performance.
        If you like to get to the party just let me hear your names for the guest list.
