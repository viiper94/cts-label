    <p>Dear {{ $name }}!</p>

    <p>Here is Olga – manager of DJ & Producer Prohor (CTS Records, Killer Mushrooms, CWR Records). 
        Atlantis - the latest release of Prohor on Killer Mushrooms Records reached Beatport top 10 Melodic House & Techno. 
        I'm now compiling a day IMS schedule for him. If you will be there Prohor would love to meet with you at IMS. 
    </p>

    <p>This year we are focused on: <br>
        - Prohor’s bookings. We are looking for booking agent/agency for arranging and handling gig requests for Europe and Asia.
        Prohor is based in Prague and available for these territories. You can check his upcoming tour dates below. <br>
        - Presenting Prohor’s IMS 2025 sampler. <br>
        At the moment he has still open several slots on Wednesday 23rd afternoon and Thursday 24th after 1.30pm till 16.30 is also available. 
        Please let me know if you would like to meet Prohor in Ibiza and suggest time slots suitable for you. 
        He prefers to arrange his meetings at the Mondrian at the lobby or close around. 
    </p>

    <p>Looking forward to hearing from you.</p>

    <p>Kind regards,</p>
